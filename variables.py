#so variables in python are like a storage but there is a something different in python 
#here you won't be needing to specify the type data you are going to contain in a variable 
#python does this explicetely so it's a dynamically typed language 

#lets see an example here :-

a=10 #here we are not specifying the type of data our variable a will contain

print(a) #this gives us 10

#type() function returns the type of the data 

print(type(a)) #this gives the type
